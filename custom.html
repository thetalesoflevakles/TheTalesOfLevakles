        <p>For my project, I decided to create a website that would be dedicated to a book that I have been wanting to write for quite some time.  I started the project in the Winter Semester of 2017 as a freshman before my mission.  It wasn't until then that I first thought that it might be cool to write a novel similar to books that I loved reading and watching movies for.  Essentially, this writing project has been years in the making, but I'm proud to have finally honed my ideas into a novel that excites me and is something that I would want to share with the world.</p>
        <p>The following books and movies are works that inspired my thinking and helped me come up with my own ideas.  They are listed in order of their significance:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Harry Potter 
                <p><img src="https://media.harrypotterfanzone.com/deathly-hallows-us-childrens-edition.jpg" height="150"></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>I loved how immersive these books and movies are!  To this day, it's easy to fit yourself inside of the wizarding world and I wanted to replicate this sensation for any readers who give my novels a chance.</li>
                    <li>One of my favorite parts of J.K. Rowling's work is how much lore there is throughout the series - especially as it begins to unfold in the final two books around Voldemort.  I definitely want to unravel an overarching story in a similar way.</li>
                    <li>Perhaps the best quality of J.K. Rowling's books was how dynamic her characters are.  When reading Harry Potter, you feel like you are witnessing the characters grow up and you get very attached.  I want my readers to feel the same way as I felt about these characters.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>    
            </li>
            <li>Percy Jackson
                <p><img src="https://pictures.abebooks.com/isbn/9780439861304-us.jpg" height="150"></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>I have fond memories of the connection that I felt to Percy as I read these books.  He was so flawed and human, that I felt like I knew him.  I really want my main character, Carther, to come across this way to the reader.</li>
                    <li>One of the best parts of this series is how relationships unfolded and changed over time.  This made it possible for me to feel invested in the characters and their relationships.  I want to make my characters feel the same way.</li>
                    <li>An important aspect of this novel was the mystery and unfolding plot that dragged Percy into the mess he found himself in.  I liked learning about the magical world this way and want to replicate it in my book.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>    
            </li>
            <li>The Hunger Games
                <p><img src="https://pictures.abebooks.com/isbn/9780545310581-us.jpg" height="150"></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>I have never been so invested in the suspense of a novel like I was when I was reading The Hunger Games.  I zoomed through this book, loving every page.  Suspense will be a huge part of my novel.</li>
                    <li>Part of the magic of this book series was the subliminal messaging that took place as I was reading the novel.  I want to use my book as an allegory for other arguments and opinions.</li>
                    <li>The readers of The Hunger Games were appalled by the violence that was being thrust upon the kids in the novel, yet the conditions that caused the infamous events to take place were understandable, though flawed.  I liked using my emotional reasoning as I read this book and hope my readers can do the same.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>    
            </li>
            <li>Star Wars
                <p><img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71Jc8+hEt7L._AC_UF1000,1000_QL80_.jpg" height="150"></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Who doesn't love the force?  I know that I loved watching it in action and want to involve gravity in my books to create a similar interest.</li>
                    <li>I don't think that there is a more infamous villain and story arc than that of Anakin Skywalker to Darth Vader.  If I can come anywhere close to this in my book, I will have been successful.</li>
                    <li>I loved Star Wars and considered myself a huge fan until the Sequel Trilogy came out!  Since Disney decided to trash the Star Wars Universe (in my opinion), I decided I wanted to create a new sci-fi story that had similar appeal but was unscathed by political ideas and cheap production.<br><br>For fun, I've included this video that highlights some of my "favorite" things about The Rise of Skywalker:<br><br>

                    I also wanted to include this fun tableau chart that shows how IMDB and others compare the other Star Wars films to the sequel films:<br><br>

            <li>The City of Ember
                <p><img src="https://embed.cdn.pais.scholastic.com/v1/channels/tso/products/identifiers/isbn/9780375822742/alternate/0/renditions/500" height="150"></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>This is a beautiful novel that inspired my idea for an isolated society in the sky.</li>
                    <li>There is a curiosity that permeates throughout this novel about a world that exists beyond the confines of their underground city.  I want to create a similar feeling of wonder and amazement by what the characters find.</li>
                    <li>There is a sense of desperation in this novel that really defines the suspense that the reader feels.  Missing information in this novel also creates a sense of neglect that tugs at the reader and makes them uncomfortable, but invested.  I loved this approach and want to use this technique to get my readers as invested.</li>
                </ul>
